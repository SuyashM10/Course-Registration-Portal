Follow the steps below before running the project:
1)The user needs to download a prerequisite: Xammp controller and php 8.1.7 version in the system to execute the project
2) Now the user needs to paste all these files except the MySQL file in the 'htdocs' folder located at "C:\Xampp\htdocs" so that we can load them through the localhost.
3) Search Xampp in windows search bar and open it. Start the Apache file and the Sql.
4) On starting the sql, click on admin button beside the start button, it will redirect you to MyPhpAdmin site where you can import the 'onlinecourse' database created and stored in the MySQL file.
5) After importing the database, the user will find the sections like admin info, student info, course, news displayed on the front end etc.
6) Every change that the user makes to the php files in the project folder is stored at 'onlinecourse' database since they are linked to MySQL database. Thus, making it easy to review, find location for changes and errors.
7) Now that the user has completed the steps above, the user needs to open the web browser and type 'localhost/Course_Registration_Portal-main/index.php' to access the project site/main page.
Note: Make sure that the project documents (php files) are stored at "C:\xampp\htdocs" and the apache and the MySQL are started in the Xampp control panel.
8) Every input on the site is stored at 'onlinecourse'Â database.
